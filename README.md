This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles: attempting to copy a file that doesn't exist in the build context. The initial Dockerfile will fail to build because it tries to copy a missing requirements.txt file. The solution demonstrates the proper way to handle dependencies by ensuring the requirements.txt file is present in the build context before the COPY command.
